üëã Hi there! I'm RP, an Android Engineer based in London with a love for all things mobile and a healthy respect for ExoPlayer migrations (oh, the stories I could tell!). I‚Äôm currently part of the tech team at Sky, where I've been wrangling code, hunting down tech debt, and mentoring our talented juniors, all while keeping a critical project in top shape‚Äîno pressure, right? Fun fact: this project brings in a good few millions per quarter, so let‚Äôs just say my error count is‚Ä¶ ‚Äúminimized.‚Äù

Over the years, I've worked on Android and iOS apps, even throwing in a bit of Python magic to save time on release processes. I've also dabbled in CI/CD pipelines, refactored data layers, and introduced design patterns for smoother, bug-free experiences. I'm the kind of guy who thinks "legacy project" is just code for "high-stakes puzzle."

When I'm not decoding bugs or optimising pipelines, you'll find me diving into physics books, trying to wrap my head around the mysteries of the universe (no big deal). There's something about trying to understand spacetime that really makes debugging legacy projects seem a lot simpler.

Oh, and if you‚Äôre looking for stories about team tech sessions or why modular architecture is basically my love language, feel free to reach out.
