ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Raul, an Android Engineer based in London with a passion for building smooth, reliable mobile experiences. Iâ€™m currently part of the tech team at Sky, where I focus on improving critical projects, mentoring junior developers, and keeping things running efficientlyâ€”no small task, but one I enjoy tackling every day.

In my experience, Iâ€™ve worked on both Android and iOS apps, streamlined processes with a touch of Python, and introduced patterns to make our code more maintainable and robust. Iâ€™ve also explored areas like CI/CD and refactoring data layers to help teams deliver better apps with fewer headaches. I see legacy projects not as problems, but as opportunities to solve complex puzzles with high impact.

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading about physics and exploring the mysteries of the universe. Itâ€™s a humbling reminder of how small bugs are in the grand scheme of thingsâ€”though I still treat them with the same curiosity and care.

If youâ€™d like to chat about building maintainable code, team knowledge sharing, or why modular architecture is a game-changer, Iâ€™d love to connect.
